A project that connects mongo and graphql, using Apollo, mongoose, webpack, and babel.

I benefited greatly from taking a look at the following two projects:

* https://github.com/khadorkin/apollo-server-mongoose
* https://github.com/sarkistlt/mongoose-schema-to-graphql

While this is mainly a proof of concept that won't be expanded upon too much, there will be a few updates to this project:

* connect more types (other than just todo at this point) to an associated mongo collection
* show relations between various types
